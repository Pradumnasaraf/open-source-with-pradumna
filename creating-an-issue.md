## Creating an Issue on GitHub

To raise an issue, go to the repository you would like to raise an issue on using the link - `https://github.com/{repo-owner}/{repo-name}/issues`

1. When you are on your repository of choice, you should be able to see various icons. Don't worry if you don't know what each icon does, simply look for the **Issues Icon** which is located next to the **Code Icon**. Note that this is not always the case as some repositories have the `Issues diabled` letting you know that they do not accept issues being raised or simply have another alternative to how they accept users to raise issues in their repositories such as via **Jira**.

2. If the `Issues Icon` is enabled, click on it and you should able to see something similar to the image below (image goes below). You will be able to see all the open issues, if any, and also be able to open your own.

3. Click on the green **New Issue** button located on your far right of your screen after the `labels` and `milestones`. This will take you to a new blank issue which has the following important parts to take note of: `title`, `main body` and the `submit new issue` button at the bottom. On your right side, you will see the following: assignee, labels, projects, milestones and developement. Do not pay attention to these but rather focus on the dialogue box on your left.

  + Title: this is where you add your title and it should match the accepted GitHub standards of creating a title by letting the maintainer and other contributors know what the issue you are raising is all about just by reading the title.
  + Main body: this is where you write what the issue is about. Expand your title and explaining it in detail. Provide screenshots, videos or links to help the maintainer and other contributors know exactly what the issue is about. You can also preview what you have written and make necessary changes to it.
  + Submit new issue button: once you are satisfied with your title and main body, you can submit your issue by clicking the green **submit new issue** button at the bottom of the dialogue box.

4. Congratulations! You just created and/or raised your first issue. You can wait to receive feedback from either the maintainer(s) or any of the community members.
