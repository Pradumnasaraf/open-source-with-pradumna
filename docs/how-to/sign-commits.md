# How to Sign Commits on Github ?

Git is cryptographically secure, but it’s not foolproof. If you’re taking work from others on the internet and want to verify that commits are actually from a trusted source, Git has a few ways to sign and verify work using GPG.

## Step by step process to Sign your commit :

### Step 1 :

For signing commits you need to have git installed on your local machine and get GPG configured and your personal key installed.

To check if you have GPG configured and a personal key installed on your local machine ,type out this command `<$ gpg --list-keys>` on your terminal

```sh
$ gpg --list-keys
```

### Step 2 :

Download and install the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/download/">GPG command line tools</a> for your operating system.Generate a key using this command

```sh
$ gpg --gen-key
```

### Step 3 :

Once you have a private key to sign with, you can configure Git to use it for signing things by setting the user.signingkey config setting

```sh
$ git config --global user.signingkey 0A46826A!
```

### Step 4 :

After completeting all the above steps head on to your profile from github

    ```
