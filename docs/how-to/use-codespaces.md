# Code Spaces

A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud.

GitHub Codespaces run on a variety of VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub.com, which you can configure from 2 core machines up to 32 core machines. You can connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.

For more info you can visit this website - [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

## How to create and use Codespaces

There's broadly two ways of using GitHub codespaces :

1. From a repository.
2. Creating a template, and then using it.

### Firstly, covering how to open codespaces from a repository

1. Open the repo you want to code in click on the code button.

2. Go to the codespaces tab

3. Click on the *add* button to create a codespace.

It might take some time depending on your internet connectivity, as a new tab opens up with a codespace to work on.

The codespace opens and looks like this:

### Now, let's come to the feature of creating a codespace from github.com

1. Go to GitHub website. Select the **Codespaces** tab from the navbar.

4. I'm selecting React for example, and based on your internet connectivity, GitHub makes a code space for you.
