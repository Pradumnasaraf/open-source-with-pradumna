# Github Gist

- GitHub Gists are a simple way to share code snippets with others.
- Every gist is a Git repository, meaning it can be forked and cloned.
- When you are signed in to GitHub and you create a gist, then it gets associated with your account and you can navigate to - **[Gist Homepage](https://gist.github.com/)**
- Gists can either be Public or Secret. Public Gists show up in [Discover](https://gist.github.com/discover).
- Secret Gists don't appear in [Discover](https://gist.github.com/discover) but are not private. Anyone who has the gist URL can see the secret gist.
- If you want to keep your code private, you might want to [create a Private Repo](https://github.com/Pradumnasaraf/open-source-with-pradumna/blob/main/pages/How-to/guide/repo-private-public.md).
- Remember that you cannot convert a Public Gist into a Secret Gist, however, a secret gist can be changed to a public one by changing its visibility.
- Since Gists are also repositories, you can clone/fork it, add changes to it, and see the update history.
