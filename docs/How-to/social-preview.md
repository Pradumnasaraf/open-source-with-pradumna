# Adding social preview to your repository

When we have an open-source project, it is important to share it so people can be interested in it and be able to contribute to it. Images on social media have a great impact because they can make your content stand out from the others.

Before you add a social preview, the repository links expand to provide the repository's basic information and the owner's avatar. Like in the left picture below:

Including a picture in your repository can make it easier for others to find your project on different social media sites. For example, how the right image provided a good social preview of its repository.Â

## ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- It is recommended that you should use JPG, PNG and GIF as a file format for your images. 
- For the best quality rendering, it is recommended to keep the image at 640 by 320 pixels.
- PNG transparency is also supported. When using an image with transparency, consider how it might appear on platforms that don't support transparency or backgrounds with various colors.
- Always make your banner simple and have a readable font. So, when someone sees the link, they will understand it right away and not skip it.

**Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to add social preview to your repository ðŸš€**
