<h2 align="center">FAQ-Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

Commonly asked questions related to Open Source, Git, and GitHub:

##### 1) What is Git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. 

##### 2) What is GitHub?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

##### 3) What are the prerequisites for stepping into Open Source?

You need to have a basic understanding of git (Version control system) and a code hosting platform like GitHub.

##### 4) Can I contribute to Open Source if I have no prior coding experience or I am from a non-technical background?

Yes, you can contribute to documentation, articles and tutorials, testing/user experience, design, translation, etc.

##### 5) Where to learn Git and GitHub?

You can check out resources in [How to?](How-to/README.md), [Resources](Resources.md), and [Bootcamp](Bootcamp.md) pages for the same.

##### 6) How to get started with Open Source?

Steps:

- 1) Start with learning the basics of **Git** and **GitHub**. You can check out resources in, [Resources](Resources.md), [Bootcamp](Bootcamp.md), and [How to?](How-to/README.md).

- 2) Once you are familiar with the basics, start contributing to beginner-friendly projects to get familiar with the workflow and terminology of Open Source, Git, and GitHub. You can find some projects on the [Begginer Friendly Projects](Beginners.md) page. Also, contributing to your friend's project is a great way to get started.

- 3) Do join a community so that you can get help and guidance from the community members if you get stuck somewhere. I will recommend joining EddieHub Community on [Discord](http://discord.eddiehub.org/).

- 4) Once you are comfortable with the workflow, you can start contributing to Open Source projects depending on your interest, programming language, topics, etc. I will recommend starting with small projects and then moving on to bigger projects. Also, when you start with a project, first try solving and working on issues with the label `good first issue` and `first timers only`. This is a wonderful way to understand a project better and then move on to other issues. Also, I have written a Blog on [5 ways to find projects in Open Source](https://blog.pradumnasaraf.dev/5-ways-to-find-projects-in-open-source) you can check it out.
