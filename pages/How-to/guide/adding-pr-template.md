# Create a PR Template

Creating a PR template makes it easy to clarify what the proposed changes will do and receive actionable feedback from your team. Having a custom template facilitates clear communication between all team members and ensures that everyone is on the same page.

You can create a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ subdirectory` in any of the supported folders to contain multiple pull request templates, and use the template query parameter to specify the template that will fill the pull request body.

### Steps to successfully create a PR Template :

#### There are two steps ways in which you can create a PR Template:

1. To store your file in a hidden directory, name the pull request template `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

 <div align="center">

 </div>
 </br>
  <div align="center">

 </div>
 </br>

2. After creating the `pull_request_template.md` file you have to write the body of the new file, add your pull request template. This could include:
   a. A reference to a related issue in your repository.
   b. A description of the changes proposed in the pull request.
   c. Mention the person or team responsible for reviewing proposed changes.
   Here is the demo of a template:

    </div>
    </br>
