# Create a PR Template

Creating a PR template makes it easy to clarify what the proposed changes will do and receive actionable feedback from your team. Having a custom template facilitates clear communication between all team members and ensures that everyone is on the same page.

You can create a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ subdirectory` in any of the supported folders to contain multiple pull request templates, and use the template query parameter to specify the template that will fill the pull request body.

### Steps to successfully create a PR Template : 
#### There are two steps ways in which you can create a PR Template:
1. To store your file in a hidden directory, name the pull request template `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

     <div align="center">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78820926/172212505-5eb9d121-3dcc-4ef2-87dd-06cdcc9e6396.png" alt="Creating a new file using the 'Create new file' option under the 'Add file' button" />
     </div>
     </br>
      <div align="center">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78820926/172214830-3f858f92-da44-41ec-82cb-1325ec3d7742.png" alt="Naming the file as 'pull_request_template.md'" />
     </div>
     </br>

2. After creating the `pull_request_template.md` file you have to write the body of the new file, add your pull request template. This could include:
     a. A reference to a related issue in your repository.
     b. A description of the changes proposed in the pull request.
     c. Mention the person or team responsible for reviewing proposed changes.

     </br>
