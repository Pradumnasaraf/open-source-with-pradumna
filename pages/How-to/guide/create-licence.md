# How to create a license
Licenses are files or permissions of what others can do with our source code. Github has recently come up with a website [ChooseALicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/) to help the user choose their own licenses

## Steps to Create a License:
1. On Github.com. Then go to the main page of the repository for which you want to add license.
2. Above the list of files, click add files, and choose "create new file".

3. In the file name, type "LICENSE.md" (all capital).
4. At the right side of file name, click "choose license type"

5. On the left side, you would have many license options to choose from. Pick one according to your vision.

If you have multiple authors to give credit, you shall refer this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)
8. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see ["Creating a new pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
9. Click "Commit Changes".
And then... Congratulations on creating a license for your project.
