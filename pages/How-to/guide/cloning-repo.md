# Cloning a repo

In order to contribute to a repo, you have to first set it up on your local system. This process of creating a local copy of the repo is known as cloning a repository.

### Steps to successfully clone a repository : 

1. In order to clone a repo, the first step that needs to be done is to `Fork` the repo. You can do this by clicking on the **Fork** button which is at the top right corner of your screen. After you click the **Fork** you will directed to a page where you can give the repo a different name or decsription, which will be visible in the forked copy of the repo.

2. After creating a fork, now you can clone the project using the green `Code` Button. When you click the button several options will appear from where you have to select **HTTPS** and then copy the https link.

3. Now after copying the link, lets go to your local terminal (preferably **Git Bash** terminal). For creating a local copy of the repo, you have to write a Git command in your terminal(Make sure that you have git installed in your system already) which is :
```
git clone <repo URL>
```
 - Right click and select the `Paste` option to paste the copied link on your Git Bash terminal as shown below.

4. You will now see a folder created by the same name as of your forked repository where all the code and files will be available
