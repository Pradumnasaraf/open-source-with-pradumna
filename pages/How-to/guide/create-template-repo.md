# How to create a template repo?

You can make an existing repository a template, so you and others can generate new repositories with the same directory structure, branches, and files.

## Step by step process to create a template repo :

### Step 1 :

- Create a repository first ([see here](https://github.com/Pradumnasaraf/open-source-with-pradumna/blob/main/pages/How-to/guide/create-repo.md)).
- Ignore this step if you already have one.

### Step 2 :

- Navigate to the main page of the repository, click ***Settings***.

**Notes :**

- After you make your repository a template, anyone with access to the repository can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as your default branch. 
- They can also choose to include all the other branches in your repository. 
- Branches created from a template have unrelated histories, so you cannot create pull requests or merge between the branches.
