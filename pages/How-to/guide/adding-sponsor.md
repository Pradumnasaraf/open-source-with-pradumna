## What is GitHub Sponsor?
The mission of GitHub Sponsors is to provide opportunities to participate in and build on open source. The advent of GitHub Sponsors and other third-party sponsorship models helps our industry take the right steps in making open source careers possible. GitHub Sponsors offers a native solution for individuals and corporations to sponsor open source maintainers and contributors.

### Who are eligible for getting sponsored?
Anyone who contributes to an open source project and lives in a supported region is eligible to become a sponsored developer. Contributions include but are not limited to bug reports, issue triage, code, documentation, leadership, business development, project management, mentorship, and design. If you live in a region that isn't already supported by GitHub Sponsors, you can sign up for the waitlist to participate in the GitHub Sponsors.
