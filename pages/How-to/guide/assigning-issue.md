  <h1>Creating and assigning an issue from a repository</h1>
  
  <p> Issues are important as they alert a maintainer to review and make new changes or receive information. These Information could include bugs, new ideas, feedback etc.

They are also a number of ways to creating an issue from a GitHub repository. 
    
However, it could also use the following steps.</p>

<div>

<h5>  Step 1 </h5>

<p> Navigate to the main repository and just below the repository name, click on issues and create new issues. </p>

  <h5>  Step 2 </h5>



<p> When the new issue page opens, you can write a title describing the issue. You could also attach files to show these issues clearly.</p>

<p><b> Assigning </b> someone to work on the identified issue can be done using the assignees button on the left panel. </p>

<p> You can also add a label tag, showing the type of issue for better explanation. </p>

<p> <b> Open source secret </b> for open source newbies, searching for `good first issue`can bring up easy to fix issues. </p>

<p> Thus, the tag system helps to make this categorization easier for others to find and fix.

After Assigning and labeling, you can now submit.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p> Your issue becomes open after submitting and the issue count increases. The assigned party is also notified.

And, that's one way to create and assign an issue from the GitHub page. </p>
