-  Now you simply made the copy of repo in your own account. All the repo files and even the commit history is preserved.

- Also link to original repo, often called upstream repo

Step 2: Make modifications to the repository.
- The changes made are actually made in your local repository but not in the original repository.


Step 3: Create a PR to the repo owner to pull changes(or merge your changes) into the original   repo.
- Once the PR is accepted and merged by the maintainer/owner, the modifications you made will be made to the original repo.


Step 4: Delete the forked repository (optional incase you no longer want to work on a repo)

- A group of developers who work on a common codebase and synchronize their changes are the ones who usually uses Git Clone.

- Fork creates a new codebase and updates to the fork are not synchronized with the original repo.
